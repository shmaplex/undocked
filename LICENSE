PREAMBLE

The Common Sense License (CSL) is a pro-community, pro-worker
license designed to prevent the extraction of free labor from
open-source communities by large corporations, platform
monopolies, and entities with disproportionate economic power.

CSL protects:
    1. Free use for individuals, nonprofits, cooperatives,
       researchers, academics, public-interest developers, and
       small businesses;
    2. Mandatory reciprocity for large-scale commercial users
       who derive significant economic value from the Software;
    3. Community autonomy through transparent governance,
       enforceable audit rights, and anti-evasion rules;
    4. Rights of workers, contributors, and maintainers through
       ethical-use restrictions and labor-credit recognition.

If you profit significantly from the commons, you must
contribute proportionally back to the commons.

The precise terms and conditions follow.
